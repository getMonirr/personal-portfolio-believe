# Personal-Portfolio-Believe
A personal portfolio is essential for all. It represents a personality of a person. So it is a motivated self-explainer website. To create this I use pure HTML5 and CSS3. Also used Google fonts and font Awesome icon. Specially use CSS flexbox. CSS flexbox is a powerful great feature that allows you to create a complex design in an easy way. if you are interested please read this blog.
